Program 4. (40 Points) Word Search 

Given the word find puzzle below (http://uahcs.org/CS121/data/word_puzzle_2D_problem_six.txt) locate and print out all four letter words. The words can appear in their normal form or reversed and both horizontal or vertical. (no diagonal words) You can start with the program we did in class that found words in an input scramble. (linkLinks to an external site.) Your program should have a function that can reverse the characters in order to search for reversed words in the puzzle. (We did one in class) The puzzle, shown below, contains ten lines with ten letters in each line. You must read the puzzle data from a file. Do not hard code this specific puzzle in your program.

Some Help: You may use a one dimensional array of strings to store the ten lines of the puzzle. Just read the lines from the file into the array to get started. You may also use the binary search function from problem 3 above to search the dictionary.
